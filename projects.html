            <p>This Python-based program predicts academic progression outcomes for students based on credit inputs in
                pass,
                defer, and fail categories. It efficiently handles multiple inputs with validation to ensure accurate
                credit totals and appropriate progression categories, such as Progress, Trailing, Module Retriever, and
                Exclude.
                The program also generates a visual histogram using the graphics.py module, allowing users to see
                the distribution of outcomes. Additionally, it stores data in lists and text files for further analysis,
                making it a robust and versatile tool for academic staff.</p>
